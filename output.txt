feat(performance): Optimize font loading and improve INP

This commit addresses performance bottlenecks related to font loading and interaction latency (INP).

Changes include:
- Integrated `@nuxtjs/google-fonts` to efficiently load 'Plus Jakarta Sans', 'Allan', 'Rethink Sans', and 'DM Sans' with optimal weights and `display: swap`.
- Eliminated redundant Google Fonts `@import` statements and hardcoded `<link>` tags across CSS files and `nuxt.config.ts` to prevent duplicate requests.
- Configured Tailwind CSS in `nuxt.config.ts` to map `font-jakarta`, `font-sans`, `font-serif`, and `font-dm` classes to their respective font families.
- Simplified the `fade-up` CSS transition easing in `app/components/Finance/HeroSection.vue` to `ease-out`.
- Disabled the continuous `loading-bar` animation in `app/assets/css/main.css` to reduce persistent rendering overhead.

These optimizations aim to enhance both the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and Interaction to Next Paint (INP) metrics for a smoother user experience.
