I've identified the "No match found for location" warnings as the core issue for your deployment problems. These warnings indicate that your NuxtLink components were pointing to routes that didn't have corresponding page files defined.

I have created placeholder page files for the missing routes:
-   `app/pages/contact-us.vue`
-   `app/pages/3.vue`

These new files should allow the Vue Router to find matches for `/contact-us` and `/3`, preventing the warnings from appearing. This might also resolve any rendering issues you were experiencing if the router warnings were causing the application to behave unexpectedly.

**Next Steps to Verify the Fix:**
1.  **Rebuild your project locally.**
2.  **Redeploy your application to Vercel.**
3.  **Check your Vercel deployment preview.**
4.  **Open your browser's developer console** and confirm that the "[Vue Router warn]: No match found for location with path..." messages are no longer present.

If the page is still blank or broken, or if new errors appear, please provide those details, including any Vercel build/runtime logs.

I'm ready for your next instruction!
